        <p>I was lucky to visit and intern at multiple places during my study. In summer 2023, I interned at J.P. Morgan AI Research, hosted by Antigoni Polychroniadou. In spring 2022, I visited Yuval Ishai at Technion. In summer 2020, I interned at Alibaba Gemini Lab (now <a href="https://antcplab.github.io/docs/about/">Ant CP Lab</a>), hosted by Cheng Hong. In summer 2019, I did an internship via <a href="https://summer.epfl.ch/">Summer@EPFL</a> program, hosted by Jean-Pierre Hubaux.
