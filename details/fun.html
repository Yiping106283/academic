        <h3>Randomness on the Street</h3>
        <p>If you were asked to pick a random number between 1 and 100, what would you pick? Here are the (sorted) answers I got from asking people around me and random people on the street: 5, 8, 9, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 30, 37, 52, 63, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 75, 75, 76, 77, 79, 86, 99. Staring at these numbers, you will be surprised by how <strong>not</strong> random they are! Most of the numbers are odd, and almost a half of the numbers contains 7. Strangely enough, there is not even a single number that contains 4! It is interesting that we have a fixed perspective of random numbers in mind that is actually far from random.  </p>
